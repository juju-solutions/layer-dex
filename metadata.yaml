name: dex
summary: identity service that uses OpenID Connect to drive authentication for other apps.

    Dex is NOT a user-management system, but acts as a portal to other identity
    providers through "connectors." This lets dex defer authentication to LDAP
    servers, SAML providers, or established identity providers like GitHub,
    Google, and Active Directory. Clients write their authentication logic
    once to talk to dex, then dex handles the protocols for a given backend.
